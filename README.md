# Simple Django dictionary app

This is my sample project, done on the Django framework.

This is the simple dictionary app. It has two pages - "Add Word" allows to add new words to the dictionary, the original and it's translation. The page "Words List" has the table with all words in the database - every row has an original word, a translation and a button, that allows to remove an entry from the database.
